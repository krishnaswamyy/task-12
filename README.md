TASK 12: CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION USING KMEANS

OBJECTIVE
---------
To segment customers into different groups based on
their Annual Income and Spending Score using the
KMeans clustering algorithm.


DATASET
-------
File Name: Mall_Customers.csv
Description: Customer dataset containing income and
spending behavior information.


FEATURES USED
-------------
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1–100)


LIBRARIES USED
--------------
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn


METHODOLOGY
-----------
1. Load the dataset
2. Select required features
3. Apply feature scaling
4. Use Elbow Method to find optimal clusters
5. Train KMeans clustering model
6. Visualize customer clusters
7. Save segmented dataset


ALGORITHM
---------
KMeans Clustering


EVALUATION
----------
- Elbow Method
- Cluster Visualization


OUTPUT
------
- Elbow Curve
- Cluster Plot
- Segmented dataset saved as:
  Mall_Customers_Segmented.csv


CONCLUSION
----------
KMeans clustering successfully groups customers
based on their spending behavior and income.
This helps businesses understand customer segments
and improve marketing strategies.
